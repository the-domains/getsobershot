# HOW IT WORKS

[GetSober][0]**(tm) **acts as a powerful anti-oxidant and fights to lower the amount of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, the neurotransmitter that causes your neurons to slow down.  This slowing effect is amplified by drinking and is the cause of those drunk tendencies; decreased cognition, poor motor skills, judgement, and inhibitions.  You can start to _black out_ or _become unconscious_ due to GABA.  This is where [GetSober][0]**(tm) ****works**!

[GetSober][0]**(tm) **fights to reverse the negative side-effects of drinking by binding to the same receptor sites that GABA binds to, thus blocking the negative effects.  There is a study that shows [GetSober][0]**(tm) ****works to sober you up over 14x faster** than if you were to stop drinking alone. **14x faster!**[GetSober][0]**(tm) **will provide you with **mental clarity** and **focus**, all while **preventing hangovers**!

On top of that, [GetSober][0]**(tm) ****aids your liver** in the breakdown of Acetaldehyde which is one of the main causes of those next morning hangovers symptoms like _nausea, headaches,_and_grogginess_.
